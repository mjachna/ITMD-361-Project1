				<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello and welcome to my webiste. I am a second year student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I'm majoring in Information Technology and Managment with a specialization in security. My time at IIT has made me very interested in programing languages. Why? Because the're awsome and fun. C++ being the one I enjoy most.</p>
					<p>To show how much I appreciate you reading this I plagiarized this joke just for you. My dog used to chase people on a bike a lot. It got so bad, finally I had to take his bike away. But, I felt bad so I'll leave a link to this completly random website <a href="http://www.short-funny.com/">Right Here</a>.</p>
					<p>Back to all about me because that's why you're here right? YEA! Since I commute I usaly only have time to work during summer, and since I'm commited to not having to take out any loans I have no life during the summer. Last year I worked at UPS and as an IT intern at a school. This year I had the pleasure of construction. In addition, I thought i had some experience with HTML from what I learned in high school... apperently I was wrong becasue bgcolor and other tags I learned are very bad. You can find out more by checking out the rest of my website with the links above.</p>
